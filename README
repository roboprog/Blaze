Welcome to Blaze.

Blaze is intended to be used as either a scripting language,
or as a semi-compiled (tokenized) language supporting packaged binaries.

Well, what kind of language?
----------------------------
Originally, one that was to steal some of the best (says who?) features
of Perl and (Turbo) Pascal, as different as those are.
Don't be surprised to see elements of Ruby or C# slip in, either.

That said, there is no language definition yet.
To get a feel for things that the author thinks are important, please see:

TODO:  add details at roboprogs.com regarding Blaze...

Currently, this software does *nothing* useful.  You were warned.
Check again in a few months.

Next steps:  develop a run-time library for the language,
and re-implement the parser in terms of the new run-time.
