This directory contains the native (C) implementations of the
Blaze runtime library.

Of particular interest:
* exception handling
* stack frame definition
* object base type
* string type and methods


Some abbreviations / conventions for type and function names:
* bz: blaze
* bzc (bzc_): a blaze internal meant to be used by / from C code
* m (_m_): mutable (as opposed to immutable, which is frequently assumed)
*
